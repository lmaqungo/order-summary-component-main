## My process

I built the component with a mobile first workflow then used media queries for the desktop version.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I worked more with flexbox containers to align elements and used media queries for a bit of responsive css. This would be my first time dabbling with responsive css, after I watched a crashcourse off of YouTube. 

### Continued development

I will work more with flexbox containers and expand my knowledge with them. I will also look further into responsive css.


### Useful resources

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYq5PXgSsbE] - This helped me with flexbox
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-h8L5hgW-w&t=59s] - This introduced me to the general workflow of developing a simple responsive website. It is an html and css crashcourse. if got me a little familiar with flexbox and css media queries.
